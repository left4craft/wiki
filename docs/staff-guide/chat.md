# Chat

Chat can be locked and unlocked with `/chatlock`.

[//]: # (I'm just assuming it can be unlocked with the same command here)

To check past chat messages you can search in discord, or use [core protect's logs](/staff-guide/core#lookup) (not recommended; only applicable for messages sent in the survival server).
