# Grief Prevention

Left4Craft uses the Grief Prevention Plugin to allow players an opportunity to protect their land and valuables against mobs, griefing and other troublesome events.

## Basics

Your first claim can be started by placing a chest on the ground, which will automatically claim a 9x9 area centered on the chest. There are temporary indicators to show the borders of your land claim. You may only have one automatic chest claim at a time.

To claim land manually, you will first need to aquire a golden shovel with `/kit claim`. With the shovel right click two corners of land, the claim must be a minimum of five blocks wide and use at least 100 claim blocks. You can check see the border indicators of your claim at any time by right-clicking a block inside your claim with a stick. To get the indicators to go away, right-click a block outside of your claim.

All land claims extend to the skybox, and automatically extend down as the claim owner digs underneath their claim. This way, people mining far underneath your claim will not be affected unless you dig down there yourself.

For more information, you can read the book in-game "How to Claim Land" or watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDsjXB-BaE0&list=PL6diNfcl9_VzUvUvQWrDsQfYoSs3Oizly&index=2) (credit to Big Scary for both).
