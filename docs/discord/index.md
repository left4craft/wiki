# Discord server

**Join the Discord server at [l4c.link/discord](https://l4c.link/discord). You must then [sync your accounts](../sync) to gain access to channels.**

Connecting your Minecraft and Discord accounts proves you are a human (prevents spam bots), synchronises your nickname and rank, and allows you to talk in the Discord-Minecarft chat bridge channel.
