# Sync

To get full access to the Discord server you must connect your Discord and Minecraft accounts so your role can be synced.

- If you didn't get a message from @Left4Bot when you joined, right click the bot and send it a message: `!sync`
- The bot will give you a command like `/discord 00000000`. Run this command in-game
- If you do not now have access, try reconnecting to the server
- Ask @Staff in [#support](https://discord.com/channels/424571587413540874/424868800509509633) if you need help
