# Old worlds

So you can continue to enjoy your builds long after we update and reset, we make previous worlds available for download for as long as possible.

Other downloads are available [here](https://l4c.link/13world).

The "Compressed" links are ZIP files containing the entire world, whilst "Uncompressed" links go to a page where you can [download specific files](#how-to-download-specific-chunks). 

## How to download specific chunks

The worlds can be over 20GB in size which may be too large for some players to be able to download or save, so there is a guide for downloading just the data you need.

1. Use [this tool](https://dinnerbone.com/minecraft/tools/coordinates/) to find the names of the files you need
2. Click on the "Uncompressed" link for the world
3. Navigate to `region/`
4. Select and download all of the MCA region files you need
5. Optionally, download the `advancements/`, `playerdata/`, and `stats/` files with your UUID in the file name
6. Launch Minecraft (with the version that the world was originally made for) and create a new world using the seed from the table above
7. Move the previously downloaded files into your new local world [save folder](https://www.howtogeek.com/207484/how-to-find-your-minecraft-saved-games-folder/)
