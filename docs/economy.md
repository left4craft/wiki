### Trade

The Trade GUI allows two players to safely exchange items, money, XP (experience points), and claim blocks. Neither player can take the other's items until both accept the trade.

Initiate trade with  `/trade <player>`. The other player will have 15 seconds to accept your trade offer by clicking in chat.
