# Rules & Punishments

Left4Craft is intended to be a safe and friendly community of players of different ages. The rules are enforced to ensure all members are treated fairly and can have fun.

The rules apply to all players/members of the community. Donating does not make you exempt; *however, we're not saying we won't unban you if you donate post-punishment*. :wink:

Anyone found to have breached the rules may face [punishment as described below](#punishments).

!!! info
	It is up to staff discretion as to what constitutes a breach of the rules, and what punishment(s) may follow. The punishments listed below are a guideline, which staff are not obliged to strictly follow. The highest-ranking member of staff available at the time has the final say.

## Punishments

Not all potential punishments are listed. As previously stated, this table is a variable guideline but may be ignored by staff. A punishment may be more or less extreme than listed here, as it is the punishing member of staff's opinion on the specific situation. It will be up to their judgement if an offence surpasses severity 2.

*Severity may refer to the number of times the offence has been committed, or how bad the offence was this time.*

You may be able to [appeal](https://left4.cf/appeal) your punishment **once**.
