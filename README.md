# Left4Craft Wiki

## How to edit

Anyone with a GitHub can contribute by forking, editing, and making a pull request. *If you spot a small mistake, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/Left4Craft/wiki/issues) to get someone else to fix it.*

There is an edit button at the top (to the right of the title) on every wiki page. Clicking it will take you to the corresponding markdown file.
Pages are stored in `/docs`.
The wiki uses [PyMdown](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/) ([MkDocs-Material extension](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/pymdown/)) markdown.

> Collaborators (regular editors) or Left4Craft org/team members have write access and will not need to fork

## How to build/deploy

The CI will automatically build and deploy the site.
